# Smart Route Planning Agent

The Smart Route Planning Agent analyzes the route between a given source and destination, and communicates with other agents to fetch live analysis reports for traffic intersections found along feasible routes between the source and destination. Subsequently, the agent finds an optimal route in real-time to avoid any possible incidents such as congestion, weather, roadblocks, and accidents.
