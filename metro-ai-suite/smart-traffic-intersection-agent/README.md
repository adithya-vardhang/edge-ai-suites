## Smart Traffic Intersection Agent

The Smart Traffic Intersection Agent application analyzes various traffic scenarios at the intersection by giving driving suggestions, sending alerts, and providing an interface for other agents to plug in and get the required information about a particular traffic intersection. These deployments only happen at the edge, at each traffic intersection.
